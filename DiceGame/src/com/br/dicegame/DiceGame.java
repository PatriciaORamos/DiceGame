/**
 * This program is the simple dice game Pig. Two players take turns rolling a
 * single die. On each turn, a player will roll the die as many times as they
 * like, continually adding the total of the die, until they want to stop.
 * Whatever number they get to, that’s their score for the round and is added to
 * their overall total. However, if the player rolls a 1, their turn is
 * immediately over and their total for the round is returned to zero. Rounds
 * will continue until one player reaches 100 points.
